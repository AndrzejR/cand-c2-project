Initial sizing rationale and assumptions

Some sizing inspiration taken from:

Instance sizing
- 50000 users
- 2 visits per day per user
- each visit takes a minute
- most of traffic focused within a single region / similar time zones
    - i.e., most traffic within a couple hours in the morning and evening
100000 visits / 180 minutes ~= 500 concurrent users peaks on a typical day

- (https://www.concurrencylabs.com/blog/5-steps-for-finding-optimal-ec2-infrastructure/) 8 m5.large are enough for 1000 concurrent users, 4 should be fine for 500
- but our front end is a lighter web server, which is more CPU than memory hungry, hence 4 c5.large
- however, our site additionally has a demanding backend (let's say calculating stuff people want to see or searching for their potential new friends) 
    - additional 4 backend m5.xlarge instances for the application; those instances also work with more data, so more storage
- we don't know yet, how precise this estimate is and what the actual performance will be - we're starting with On-Demand to cost optimize later; in particular scheduled reservation may be suiting our traffic patterns


Web Site traffic
- 50000 users
- 2 visits per day per user
- 1MB web site traffic per visit (doesn't include high volume media, which is stored on S3 and downloaded through CloudFront)
50000 * 2 * 1 * 30 days = 3000000MB = 3000GB / month

S3
- 50000 users
- for each user we will store a total of 1GB in Standard on average plus 2GB of archived media in IA tier
- requests for Standard tier: 
    - 50000 users * 2 visits * 10 read media files = 1000000 * 30 = 30M GET requests
    - 50000 users * 2 visits * 1 written media file = 100000 * 30 = 3M PUT requests
- 1/10 of the above GET requests for IA tier

CloudFront (the new calculator does not seem to show this, calculated with the old one)
- 2 visits per day per user
- 10MB of media per visit
50000 * 2 * 10 * 30 days = 30000000MB = 30TB / month
- and we want a custom SSL certificate for our domain

NAT Gateway
- system and application updates
- low traffic

Route53
- we have a custom domain with some DNS traffic

RDS
- m5.xlarge
- with Multi-AZ (seems to make more sense for single region than a Read Replica mentioned in the instructions)
- 100MB per user
