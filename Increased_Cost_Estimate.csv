Increased Cost Estimate Rationale

Add a 2 region in Europe for better performance (as we open and market for our European users too) and an active-active DR site.
Most of the infrastructure in this region is a clone of what we have in US. 
RDS has a Multi-AZ Read Replica in this new region.
S3's storage is increased in the original region without adding it to the new one, as we use CloudFront anyway.
